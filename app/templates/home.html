        <h2>The Humor Genome Project is a student-centered research program whose goal is to develop a quantitative model of humor, directed by Lew Lefton, and Pete Ludovice, Georgia Tech researchers by day and stand-up/improvisational comedians by night. Begun in Spring 2013 the project applies data analytics, semantics modeling, and data collection methods to advance toward the projectâ€™s goal. Student participation occurs through the Humor Genome Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) class at Georgia Tech. Students may take this course for one or two credit hours per semester.</h2>
